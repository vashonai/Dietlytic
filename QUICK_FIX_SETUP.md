# Quick Fix Setup Guide

## 🚨 Issue Fixed: React Native Bundling Error

The error you encountered was due to the `dotenv` package trying to import Node.js standard library modules that aren't available in React Native. This has been fixed by:

### ✅ Changes Made

1. **Removed `dotenv` dependency** from frontend services
2. **Updated `config/environment.ts`** to be React Native compatible
3. **Modified AI Coach service** to use backend API instead of direct OpenAI calls
4. **Added fallback responses** when backend is unavailable

### 🔧 Configuration Update

The `config/environment.ts` file now uses:
- **Development**: `http://localhost:3001/api`
- **Production**: `https://your-production-api.com/api` (update this URL)

### 🚀 How to Run

1. **Start your backend server** (if you want full AI features):
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Start your React Native app**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### 💡 Fallback Mode

If the backend is not running, the AI Coach will work in "fallback mode" with basic responses:
- ✅ Basic conversation works
- ✅ Simple keyword-based responses
- ❌ Advanced AI features unavailable
- ❌ Meal logging unavailable

### 🔄 Full AI Features

To enable full AI Coach features:

1. **Ensure backend is running** on `http://localhost:3001`
2. **Configure your OpenAI API key** in the backend `.env` file
3. **Run database migrations** (see `database/migrations/001_add_health_and_goals_tables.sql`)

### 📱 Testing the Fix

1. **Open the AI Coach tab** in your app
2. **Try sending a message** like:
   - "I ate a sandwich for lunch"
   - "I need help with my diet"
   - "Set a goal to lose weight"

3. **Check the console** for any error messages

### 🎯 What Works Now

- ✅ App bundles without errors
- ✅ AI Coach UI loads properly
- ✅ Basic conversation functionality
- ✅ Voice input UI (web only)
- ✅ User profile display
- ✅ Fallback responses when backend unavailable

### 🔮 Next Steps

1. **Set up your backend** for full AI features
2. **Configure your production API URL** in `config/environment.ts`
3. **Add voice recognition** for React Native (optional)
4. **Test with real health conditions** and goals

The app should now run without the bundling error! 🎉
