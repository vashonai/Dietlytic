## Setup Instructions

### 1. Configure Environment Variables

1. **Copy the example file:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Edit the `.env` file:**
   ```bash
   # Replace 'your_openai_api_key_here' with your actual OpenAI API key
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-openai-api-key-here
   
   # Optional: Customize these settings
   OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo
   OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS=1000
   OPENAI_TEMPERATURE=0.7
   ```

### 2. Install Dependencies

The required packages are already installed:

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Fitness coach service is not available"**
   - Check that your `.env` file exists and has the correct API key
   - Verify your OpenAI API key is valid
   - Ensure you have credits in your OpenAI account

2. **Messages not sending**
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify the API key is correct
   - Check the console for error messages

3. **Slow responses**
   - This is normal for AI responses
   - Consider using `gpt-3.5-turbo` for faster responses
   - Reduce `OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS` for shorter responses

### Debug Mode

To see detailed error messages, check the console output when running your app.

## Security Notes

- **Never commit your `.env` file** to version control
- **Keep your API key secure** and don't share it
- **Monitor your OpenAI usage** to avoid unexpected charges
- **Use environment variables** for all sensitive data

## Cost Considerations

- **GPT-3.5-turbo**: ~$0.002 per 1K tokens (very affordable)
- **GPT-4**: ~$0.03 per 1K tokens (more expensive)
- **Monitor usage** in your OpenAI dashboard

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the console for error messages
2. Verify your API key and environment setup
3. Test with simple messages first
4. Check your OpenAI account status
