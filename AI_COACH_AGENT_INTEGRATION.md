## 🎯 **How It Works**

### **User Interaction Flow**
1. **User taps the AI Coach bubble** on the dashboard
2. **Chat interface opens** with welcome message
3. **User types or speaks** about their meal: "I ate a sandwich for lunch"
4. **AI Coach processes** the input using natural language processing
5. **AI Coach responds** with personalized feedback based on:
   - User's health conditions (diabetes, hypertension, etc.)
   - User's goals (weight loss, muscle gain, etc.)
   - Nutritional analysis of the meal
6. **AI Coach can take actions**:
   - Log the meal to food history
   - Update user goals
   - Provide specific recommendations

### **Example Conversations**
```
User: "I had a burger and fries for lunch"
AI Coach: "I see you had a burger and fries! Since you're working on weight loss, I'd recommend considering a side salad instead of fries next time. The burger provides good protein, but the fries add extra calories. Would you like me to log this meal to your food history?"

User: "I want to set a goal to lose 10 pounds"
AI Coach: "Great goal! I'll help you set a target to lose 10 pounds. This typically requires a calorie deficit of about 500 calories per day. I'll update your profile with this goal and provide meal recommendations to help you achieve it."
```

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Frontend Integration**
- **Service**: `aiCoachAgentService.ts` handles all AI Coach logic
- **Voice**: `voiceInputService.ts` manages voice input (web only)
- **UI**: Enhanced `AICoachBubble.tsx` with full chat interface
- **Backend**: API calls to `/api/chat/ai-coach` endpoint

### **Fallback System**
- **Backend Available**: Full AI Coach features with OpenAI integration
